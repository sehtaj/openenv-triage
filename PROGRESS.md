# OOD Decision-Making Environment Progress Tracker

## Stage 0
### Stage 0 Locked Decisions
- Environment direction: a production-style operational risk triage environment for high-stakes decisions under uncertainty and distribution shift.
- Base workflow: closest to fraud detection, with moderation-style ambiguity and anomaly-style distribution shift expressed through task variants.
- Fixed action space: `accept`, `reject`, `review`.
- Episode structure: multi-case decision queue, one case per step, deterministic task selection via `reset(...)`.
- Task ladder: `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, all sharing the same action and observation interface.
- Review semantics: `review` resolves the current case immediately, consumes limited review capacity, and incurs an explicit cost so it is useful on borderline cases but suboptimal on obvious ones.
- Episode calibration target: `easy` uses 20 cases with review budget 4, `medium` uses 25 cases with review budget 4, and `hard` uses 30 cases with review budget 3.
- Cost asymmetry: false accepts are materially more costly than false rejects because they allow harmful events to pass, while false rejects primarily degrade user experience or operational efficiency.

### 0.1 Product Scope Lock
- [x] Lock the environment name and one-sentence pitch around out-of-distribution decision-making for real-world AI operations.
- [x] Lock the action space to exactly `accept`, `reject`, and `review`.
- [x] Lock the primary decision workflow to match production-style triage rather than a toy classification loop.
- [x] Lock the business objective as maximizing correct decisions while minimizing costly mistakes and unnecessary reviews.
- [x] Lock the supported domains to fraud detection, anomaly detection, and moderation under one shared decision interface.
- [x] Lock the target user of the environment as an LLM-driven decision agent with optional human-review escalation.

### 0.2 Real-World Scenario Definition

- Locked case representation: each step is one operational triage record from a fixed queue, grounded in a fraud-like approval pipeline with `payment`, `content`, or `system` domain context. Each record represents a real event with actor history, event context, automated model outputs, rule flags, evidence quality signals, and a short analyst-style evidence summary.
- Locked visible observation fields:
  - Identity and context: `case_id`, `task_name`, `domain_hint`, `event_type`
  - Structured risk signals: `impact_score`, `risk_score`, `anomaly_score`, `history_risk_score`
  - Model outputs: `model_recommendation`, `model_confidence`
  - Uncertainty and OOD hints: `uncertainty_score`, `novelty_score`
  - Evidence quality: `feature_completeness`, `policy_flags`, `missing_fields`
  - Free-text evidence: `evidence_text`
  - Queue state: `queue_position`, `remaining_cases`, `remaining_review_budget`
- Locked hidden grading fields:
  - Ground truth: `true_case_class`, `optimal_decision`
  - Shift metadata: `is_ood`, `ood_type`
  - Business costs: `cost_tier`, `false_accept_cost`, `false_reject_cost`, `review_cost`
  - Deterministic action values: `action_value_accept`, `action_value_reject`, `action_value_review`
- Locked uncertainty and ambiguity rules:
  - Low confidence appears through lower `model_confidence` and higher `uncertainty_score`
  - Misleading high confidence is allowed on OOD cases, especially in `hard`
  - Missing or noisy evidence appears through `feature_completeness` and `missing_fields`
  - Explicit OOD hints appear through `novelty_score` and certain policy flags
  - Implicit OOD appears as disagreement between scores, recommendation, flags, and `evidence_text`
- Locked task-specific uncertainty profile:
  - `easy`: mostly in-distribution payment-style cases, aligned signals, high completeness, low novelty
  - `medium`: mixed payment/content cases, moderate missingness, moderate shift, more signal conflict
  - `hard`: payment/content/system cases with stronger OOD behavior, misleading confidence, more missing critical fields, and adversarial signal conflict
- Locked business-value matrix:
  - Legitimate case: correct `accept` is positive, `reject` incurs false-reject cost, `review` incurs review cost
  - Harmful case: correct `reject` is positive, `accept` incurs false-accept cost, `review` incurs review cost
  - Ambiguous case: `review` is the optimal action, while direct actions incur deterministic penalties
- Locked cost tiers:
  - `standard`: false accept `10`, false reject `4`, review `1`
  - `sensitive`: false accept `14`, false reject `5`, review `1`
  - `critical`: false accept `18`, false reject `6`, review `2`
- Locked positive action values:
  - Correct `accept`: `+3`
  - Correct `reject`: `+4`
  - Correct `review`: `+2`
